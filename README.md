# <center>Fizzo Pannosch</center>
I am a software developer. Resident to the pacific northwest. I am currently continuing my education @Codefellows in Seattle, WA - one of the best coding boot camps in the nation.
I am graduating Javascript and Pyhton in November 2021. I am looking forward to a great career in software development. I love exploring, creating and experiencing the genius mind that lies latent in everyone of us. I love people and I love business.
