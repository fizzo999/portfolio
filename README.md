# <center>Fizzo Pannosch</center>

I am a software developer. Resident to the pacific northwest. I have completed my education @Codefellows in Seattle, WA - one of the best coding boot camps in the nation.
I have graduated from 401 Advanced Software Development in JavaScript. I am looking forward to a great career in software development. I love exploring, creating and experiencing the genius mind that lies latent in everyone of us. I love people, I love business and I love creating powerful and beautiful digital products.
